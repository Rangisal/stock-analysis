# Stock-Analysis - VBA of Wall Street 
# Overview of Project 
For the given dataset of different stocks and their information relating to the performance have been analysed initialy to assess the performance of the each stocks for the given years. By clicking the button "Run analysis for all the stocks " the entire data set can be analysed. As the given data set is not included the whole stock market, the main pupose of this analysis to find out if the whole data set is expanded in the stock market in the last few years and determine how fast that the code can be run to get the desired results by refatoring the initial VBA script in the given data set. For that purpose the given data set carring 12 stocks for 2017 and 2018 will be analysed to see their performance and run time for future investments. Please see the attached link for the original data set and output worksheet. 



# Results 
## Comparison of stock performance in 2017 and 2018

As per the below comparison of the 2 tables it cleary shows the total daily volume and the return of each fund in the given 2 years. It had been a really a good year in 2017 for all the given stocks except the TERP. The stocks ENPH and RUN had been performed very good in both years. However it indicates that eventhough the total daily volume increases it still can be given a negative or less return over a year. For example the stocks DQ, HASI, SEDG, VSLR shows a negative return while ENPH a less return eventhough the volume has increased.

## Refactored Run time 

The refactored codes took 0.38 seconds to run in 2018 and took 0.35 seconds in 2017. It was less time than the original code run time. 
See the attached images of the refactored run time for each year.
